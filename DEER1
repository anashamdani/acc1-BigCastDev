      "Content":"-Health in this game runs on a tug of war system: damaging your opponent will also increase your health, and vice versa. This means that no matter how low your side of the scale is, you can still claw your way back by doing a load of damage. When the scale is balanced (needle at the top pointing straight up) it takes about 5 points of damage to defeat either opponent."

      "Content":"-Always pick Cat at the start. Adder is useful for certain things (see Map section below) but Cat is by far the most versatile card, being an infinitely reusable free sacrifice. Touch of Death is nice, but the Adder card itself is so weak that it’s unlikely to see much use."

Sacrificing the Black Goat at one of the Bone God altars will give you an upgraded version of the Boon that gives you eight bones at the start of combat."
